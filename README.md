# Connector Breakout Boards

### Easy Access to Pins of Common Connectors for Prototyping or Testing

## What Are These Boards?

They provide easy access to each pin of a connector via a pin header, labeled with the pin number and its use. If a connector contains multiple ground pins, these can be connected on the board via jumpers.

## Why Use These Boards?

They make testing or prototyping cables easier by providing a robust connection and avoiding mixing up pins.

## Getting Started

You can produce these boards

## D-Sub 9, 15, and 25

These connectors saw a wide variety of uses, therefore only pin numbers are provided on the silk screen. Each breakout board contains a pins and a socket connector.
